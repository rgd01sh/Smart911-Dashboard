# Smart911 Dashboard UI/UX Prototype

This repository contains the UI/UX design for the **Smart911 Dashboard**â€”an interactive prototype for an AI-powered emergency response system. The dashboard is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to simulate how emergency dispatchers can manage incidents, allocate resources, and monitor real-time data for improved decision-making.

## Key Features:
- **Incident List**: Displays real-time incidents with severity and location.
- **Interactive GIS Map**: Tracks emergency resources and incident locations.
- **Resource Cards**: Shows availability and status of emergency units.
- **Predictive Analytics (Placeholder)**: Simulated data visualizations for response times and injury forecasts.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

This is a **UI/UX prototype** and not a fully functional system. It is intended to demonstrate how the **Smart911 Dashboard** can look and behave before integration with backend systems.

Feel free to clone and explore the dashboard!

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
