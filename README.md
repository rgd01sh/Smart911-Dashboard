# Smart911 Dashboard UI/UX Prototype

This repository contains the UI/UX design for the **Smart911 Dashboard**â€”an interactive prototype for an AI-powered emergency response system. The dashboard is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to simulate how emergency dispatchers can manage incidents, allocate resources, and monitor real-time data for improved decision-making.

## Key Features:
- **Incident List**: Displays real-time incidents with severity and location.
- **Interactive GIS Map**: Tracks emergency resources and incident locations.
- **Resource Cards**: Shows availability and status of emergency units.
- **Predictive Analytics (Placeholder)**: Simulated data visualizations for response times and injury forecasts.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

> **Note**: This project is a **work in progress**. The prototype is not yet complete and is intended to demonstrate the UI/UX design. Backend functionality, data integrations, and real-time features are yet to be implemented.

Feel free to clone and explore the current state of the dashboard!
